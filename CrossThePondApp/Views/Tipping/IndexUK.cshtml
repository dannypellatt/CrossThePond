        <h3>Tipping Explained:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
            Tipping is not expected in Great Britain the way it is in America.
            Workers don't officially have to rely on their tips to live and all staff in the UK must be paid at least the National Minimum Wage.
            Employers are also banned from topping up wages with tips from customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it's not necessary to tip in most places you would in the US, it's always greatly appreciated
            (the National Minimum Wage does not meet the National Living Wage).
        </p>
        <p>
            Possibly due to the fact that tipping is not necesssarily expected, you may find that wait staff, though polite,
            will not be quite as attentive!
        </p>

            To the right you'll find a rough guide to tipping in some common interactions.
        </p>
        <p class="notes">Tipping is not necessary for stores, coffee shops, hotel staff, however, if you feel like it, £1-£5 is always appreciated.</p>
